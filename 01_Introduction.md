# Nuclear Fusion Game

This game aims around realistic approach to nuclear fusion reaction. The main concepts of the game are base mostly on ITER and DEMO reactor designs. These areactor are not functioning yet in real life but the Fusion game depicts a theoretical thermonuclear plant with 6 GW energy output.
Whiele the main concepts are present in the game all the systems were simplified to fit a more cooperation oriented gameplay rather than to simulate real life operations exactly.
